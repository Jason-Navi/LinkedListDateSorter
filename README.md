DateSorter Program obtains input from textfile (.txt) and sorts the data based on year. 
Then it prints on the left side of the GUI the unsorted dates and the right side of the GUI the sorted dates. 

Also prints out any invalid dates entered as a Date212 Exception as well as any combination of chars and number. 
Prints dates out in mm/dd/yyyy order.  

This project was created to sort dates by using just a Linked-List created from scratch to sort. 

You can type any series of dates in the textfile in yyyy/mm/dd order and it will run properly.  
For instance, typing in the textfile named "inputs": 1998/02/6, 1994/11/13, 1998/01/10 will display the following on different lines.

Left-hand side of GUI: 02/6/1998, 11/13/1994, 01/10/1998   

Right-hand side of GUI: 11/13/1994, 01/10/1998, 02/06/1998
